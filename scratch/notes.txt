No differences. Reassuring that Collins is unlikely to include many modifications.

## Are there differences between affixes for the same word across dictionaries?

Inspection of GB -> US dictionaries indicates this is true, e.g. wool/M -> wool/MNX (in the US – woolen/woolens, although this is already explicit in the dictionary!)

No. of words where spelling is the same but suffixes are different –

expr 4196 - $(diff ./scratch/en-GB-cut-1.txt ./scratch/en-cut-1.txt | wc -l)
> 422

So there aren't too many suffix differences between the UK and US dictionaries, currently.

It seems fair to expect there to be fewer still between en-GB and Collins.
